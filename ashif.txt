if you want to upload your files to github then 
you can give a command:
git remote add <name of your remote repo which you wnat to call . Generally we call it origin . > <link of the empty repository created on git hub>


then give command
git push -u <origin> master
you will see uploading process on your screen.



$ git push origin -u master
